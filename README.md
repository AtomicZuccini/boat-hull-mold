Project: Boat Hull Mold (STL Model)
This project contains a 3D model of a boat hull mold, designed to be used as a positive mold for creating a composite or fiberglass boat hull. The STL file (hull mold combined.stl) represents the outer shape of the final boat hull, allowing makers to fabricate the hull by layering materials over this mold and then curing and removing the structure.
